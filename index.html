          Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
          Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of <em><strong>technical
          sophistication </strong></em> taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit
          at least a billion people, and probably more. To
          join our movement, <a href="http://learnenough.com/email" target="_blank">sign
